# MySQL Translate

Pulls your MySQL schemas and outputs them where you want, for a range of filetypes.
Run from the command line.

## Why?

Autogenerating the same schema with different output types can be useful if your
database is being consumed by multiple projects you're working on.

## Where's it at?
Only the JSON output is implemented so far, which prisma to be next.

## Note
Please note that this is just a convenience project for me and would need a lot
of testing and additional output types to be particularly useful.
